##lithe - My First Attempt at a Blog in the Lithium Framework
[Lithium](https://github.com/UnionOfRAD/lithium) - Lithium is a light, fast, and highly configurable framework for PHP 5.3+

I do plan on using and testing this project in the wild for active sites, once I get everything working. In fact I will be using it before I have it finished as soon as I can edit and post. Tired of Wordpress and it's hugeness. I can get a lot of the functionality I need easily just simply switching to MongoDB instead of MySql and Lithium makes it easy.

##TODO
- Twitter Bootstrap
- Basic Posting Functionality
